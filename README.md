# US_Accident_Analysis
Overview
This project provides an analysis of a countrywide car accident dataset for the 49 states of the USA. The dataset includes over 2.8 million accident records collected from February 2016 to December 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.

Analysis
I have analyzed the dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries to gain insights into different factors that affect the frequency and severity of accidents. Some of the factors I have explored include:

Time and location of accidents
Weather conditions at the time of the accident
Road conditions and visibility
Number of vehicles involved
Severity of injuries and fatalities
I have also created visualizations to help better understand the distribution of accidents and how they relate to these factors.

Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file US_Accident_Analysis.ipynb. The notebook contains all the code used to analyze the dataset and create the visualizations.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas

Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. I would like to thank the contributors of this dataset for their hard work in collecting and organizing the data.
